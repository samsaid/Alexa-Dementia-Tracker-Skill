# Alexa-Dementia-Tracker-Skill
In the progress of creating a skill for Amazon Alexa where Echo Dot users can keep track of dementia patients' nutritional diet as caregivers and/or family members through voice activation.

i.e "Alexa, track Grandma's breakfast for 1 sugar-free oatmeal packet"
or  "Alexa, tell me what Grandma's diet looked like this week."
